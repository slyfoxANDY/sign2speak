# sign2speak
Sign2Speak is an AI-powered real-time sign language interpretation system designed to bridge the communication gap between the Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing community and non-signers. The project uses YOLOv8, advanced computer vision, and natural language processing to detect, recognize, and translate sign gestures into text and speech, also vice-versa.
